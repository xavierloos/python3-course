# 1.For the final change to our painting app, we are going to expand on the paint_mix() function to allow for new combinations to be added to our color_data.
# For the first step, define a new nested function called add_new_mixture() inside of the paint_mix() function which accepts no arguments.

# 2.Inside of the new function, access the global variable color_data and write a key, value pair using the(first_color, second_color) tuple as a key and the resulting_color as a value.

# 3.Finally, try calling paint_mix with different color combinations and adding them to the color_data variable.Any new combinations will be saved in the dictionary and can be used by the function due to itâ€™s global scope.

              ('yellow', 'blue'): 'green',
              ('blue', 'red'): 'purple'}

                        return color_data[(first_color, second_color)]
                    else:
                        return color_data[(second_color, first_color)]
