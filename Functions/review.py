# 1.Alright, this is it. We are going to use all of our knowledge of functions to build out TripPlanner V1.0.
# First, like in our previous exercises, we want to make sure to welcome our users to the application.
# Create a function called trip_planner_welcome() that takes one parameter called name. The function should use print() to output a message like this:
# Welcome to tripplanner v1.0 <Name Here>
# Where <Name Here> represents the parameter variable of name we defined.

# 2.Next, we are going to generate messages for a user‚Äôs planned trip.
# Create a function called destination_setup() that will have four parameters in this exact order:
# origin
# destination
# estimated_time
# mode_of_transport
# Give the parameter mode_of_transport a default value of "Car". The program will error out if we run it since we have not defined a function body yet. Don‚Äôt worry we will do that in the next step.

# 3.Next, we are going to write four print() statements in our function. The output on this function call should look like this:
# Your trip starts off in <origin>
# And you are traveling to <destination>
# You will be traveling by <mode_of_transport>
# It will take approximately <estimated_time> hours
# Each of these print() statements use a different parameter from our function destination_setup().
# Note: The estimated_time parameter will come in the form of a decimal. Make sure to use str() to convert the parameter in your print statement.

# 4.Lastly, we are going to define a function called estimated_time_rounded() that will allow us to calculate a rounded time value based on a decimal for our user‚Äôs trip.
# An example call for this function will look like this:
# estimated_time_rounded(2.43)
# Where 2 represents 2 hours and .43 represents 43 minutes.
# Define the function estimated_time_rounded() with a single parameter estimated_time. The function should do two things:
# Create a variable called rounded_time that is the result of calling the round() built-in function on the parameter estimated_time.
# Return rounded_time.

# 5.Great job! üëè
# We have successfully finished our first version of the trip builder application. Go ahead and uncomment the provided function calls and fill in the values with whatever you like.
# Once have filled in the arguments, run the program to see it all in action.

# Write your code below:
def trip_planner_welcome(name):
  print("Welcome to tripplanner v1.0 " + name)

# trip_planner_welcome("Mexico")
def destination_setup(origin, destination, estimated_time, mode_of_transport="Car"):
  print("Your trip starts off in " + origin )
  print("And you are traveling to " +  destination )
  print("You will be traveling by " + mode_of_transport )
  print("It will take approximately " + str(estimated_time) + " hours")

def estimated_time_rounded(estimated_time):
  rounded_time = round(estimated_time)
  return rounded_time

# Uncomment these in the last step 
trip_planner_welcome(" Mexico ")
estimate = estimated_time_rounded(2.43)
destination_setup(" London ", "Mexico ", estimate, "Car")
