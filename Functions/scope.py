# 1.Our users want to be able to save a list of their favorite places in our travel application.
# We have received a rough draft for this implementation from another coder, but there are some problems with variable scope which prevent it from working properly.
# Take a second to understand what the program is doing and then hit Run the code to see the error.

# 2.Looking at the error, it seems like the main issue is that favorite_locations is not defined. Why would our program not be able to see our beautiful favorite_locations variable?
# Aha!It must be a scope issue.Fix the scope of favorite_locations so that both our functions can access it.

# This function will print a hardcoded count of how many locations we have.
def print_count_locations():
    favorite_locations = "Paris, Norway, Iceland"
    print("There are 3 locations")
    
# This function will print the favorite locations
def show_favorite_locations():
  favorite_locations = "Paris, Norway, Iceland"
  print("Your favorite locations are: " + favorite_locations)

print_count_locations()
