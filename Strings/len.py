# 1.Copelandâ€™s Corporate Company also wants to update how they generate temporary passwords for new employees.
# Write a function called password_generator() that takes two inputs, first_name and last_name, and then concatenates the last three letters of each and returns them as a string.

# 2.Test your function on the provided first_name and last_name and save it to the variable temp_password.

first_name = "Reiko"
last_name = "Matsuki"


def password_generator(first_name, last_name):
    psswrd = first_name[len(first_name)-3:] + last_name[len(last_name)-3:]
    return psswrd


temp_password = password_generator(first_name, last_name)
