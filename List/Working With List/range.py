# 1. Modify number_list so that it is a range containing numbers starting at 0 and up to, but not including, 9.
 
# 2. Create a range called zero_to_seven with the numbers 0 through 7.
# Print the result in list form.

# Your code below: 

number_list = range(9)
print(list(number_list))

zero_to_seven = range(8)
print(list(zero_to_seven))

# The Power of Range!
# 1. Modify the range() function that created the range range_five_three such that it:
# Starts at 5
# Has a difference of 3 between each item
# Ends before 15

# 2.Create a range called range_diff_five that:
# Starts at 0
# Has a difference of 5 between each item
# Ends before 40

# Your code below: 

range_five_three = range(5, 15, 3)

range_diff_five = range(0,40,5)
