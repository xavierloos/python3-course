# 1. Modify number_list so that it is a range containing numbers starting at 0 and up to, but not including, 9.
 
# 2. Create a range called zero_to_seven with the numbers 0 through 7.
# Print the result in list form.

# Your code below: 

number_list = range(9)
print(list(number_list))

zero_to_seven = range(8)
print(list(zero_to_seven))
