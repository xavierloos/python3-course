# 1.Use sorted() to order games and create a new list called games_sorted.

# 2.Print both games and games_sorted.How are they different?

games = ["Portal", "Minecraft", "Pacman", "Tetris", "The Sims", "Pokemon"]

# Your code below:
games_sorted = sorted(games)
print(games)
print(games_sorted)

# 4. Substring Between
# Here is a challenging problem. We need a function that is able to extract a portion of a string between two characters. The function will take three parameters where the first parameter is the string we are going to extract the substring from, the second input is the starting character of our substring and the third character is the ending character of our substring. Here are the steps we can use:
# Define the function to accept three parameters, one string and two characters
# find the starting index of our substring using the second input parameter
# find the ending index of our substring using the third input parameter
# If neither of the indices are -1, return the portion of the first input parameter string between the starting and ending indices (not including the starting and ending index)
# If either of the indices are -1, that means the start or end of the substring didn’t exist in our string. Return the original string in this case.


def substring_between_letters(word, start, end):
    start_ind = word.find(start)
    end_ind = word.find(end)
    if start_ind > -1 and end_ind > -1:
        return(word[start_ind+1:end_ind])
    return word


# Uncomment these function calls to test your function:
print(substring_between_letters("apple", "p", "e"))
# should print "pl"
print(substring_between_letters("apple", "p", "c"))
# should print "apple"

# 5. X Length
# Let’s use the split method in a different way. We need a new function that is able to accept two inputs: one for a sentence and another for a number. The function returns True if every single word in the sentence has a length greater than or equal to the number provided. These are the steps:
# Define the function to accept two parameters, one string, and one number
# Split up the sentence into an array of words
# Loop through the words. If the length of any of the words is less than the provided number return False
# If we made it through the loop without returning False then return True


def x_length_words(sentence, x):
    sentence = sentence.split()
    for word in sentence:
        if len(word) < x:
            return False
    return True
    # return sentence


# Uncomment these function calls to test your tip function:
print(x_length_words("i like apples", 2))
# should print False
print(x_length_words("he likes apples", 2))
# should print True
