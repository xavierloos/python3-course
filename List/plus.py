# 1. Jiho is updating a list of orders. He just received orders for "lilac" and "iris".

# Create a list called new_orders that contains our new orders.

# 2. Use + to create a new list called orders_combined that combines orders with new_orders.

# 3. Remove the # and whitespace in front of the list broken_prices. If you run this code, youâ€™ll get an error:

# TypeError: can only concatenate list(not "int") to list

# Fix the command by inserting brackets ([ and ]) so that it will run without errors.

orders = ["daisy", "buttercup", "snapdragon", "gardenia", "lily"]

# Create new orders here:
new_orders = ["lilac", "iris"]

orders_combined = orders + new_orders
broken_prices = [5, 3, 4, 5, 4] + [4]
