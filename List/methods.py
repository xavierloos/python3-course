# We will be exploring .append() and many other methods in the upcoming exercises but for now take a second to examine and play around with the code for two common list methods.

example_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]

#Using Append
example_list.append(5)
# print(example_list)

#Using Remove
example_list.remove(5)
# print(example_list)
