# 1. Count Letters
# For the first code challenge, we are going to count the number of unique letters in a string. This means that when we are looking at the word, any new letters should be counted and any duplicates should not be counted. There are a few ways to solve this, but we can use the provided alphabet string to ensure that duplicates are not counted. Here is what we need to do:
# Define the function to accept one parameter â€” the word whose letters we are counting
# Create a counter to keep track of unique letters
# Loop through every letter in our alphabet string. If the current letter was found in our word, increase our count
# Return the count after looping through all letters.

letters = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
# Write your unique_english_letters function here:


def unique_english_letters(word):
    counter = []
    for letter in word:
        if letter in letters:
            if not letter in counter:
                counter.append(letter)

    return len(counter)


# Uncomment these function calls to test your function:
print(unique_english_letters("mississippi"))
# should print 4
print(unique_english_letters("Apple"))
# should print 4
