# 1.We have been provided a list of grades in a physics class. Using a list comprehension, create a new list called scaled_grades that scales the class grades based on the highest score.

# Since the highest score was a 90 we simply want to add 10 points to all the grades in the list.

# 2.Print scaled_grades.

grades = [90, 88, 62, 76, 74, 89, 48, 57]

scaled_grades = [grade + 10 for grade in grades]

print( scaled_grades)
