# 1.We have provided the list sales_data that shows the numbers of different flavors of ice cream sold at three different locations: Scoopcademy, Gilberts Creamery, and Mannyâ€™s Scoop Shop.
# We want to sum up the total number of scoops sold. Start by defining a variable scoops_sold and set it to zero.

# 2.Loop through the sales_data list using the following guidelines:
# For our temporary variable of the for loop, call it location.
# print() out each location list.

# 3.Within our sales_data loop, nest a secondary loop to go through each location sublist element and add the element value to scoops_sold.
# By the end, you should have the sum of every number in the sales_data nested list.

# 4.Print out the value of scoops_sold outside of the nested loop.

sales_data = [[12, 17, 22], [2, 10, 3], [5, 12, 13]]
