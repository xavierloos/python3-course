# 1.Create a list called single_digits that consists of the numbers 0-9 (inclusive).

# 2.Create a for loop that goes through single_digits and prints out each one.

# 3.Before the loop, create a list called squares. Assign it to be an empty list to begin with.

# 4.Inside the loop that iterates through single_digits, append the squared value of each element of single_digits to the list squares. You can do this before or after printing the element.

# 5.After the for loop, print out squares.

# 6.Create the list cubes using a list comprehension on the single_digits list. Each element of cubes should be an element of single_digits taken to the third power.

# 7.Print cubes.

# Good job!

# Your code below:
single_digits = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]

squares = []

for digit in single_digits:
  squares.append(digit ** 2)

print(squares)

cubes = [digit ** 3 for digit in single_digits]

print(cubes)
