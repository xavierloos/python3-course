# 1. You’ve decided to get into quilting! To calculate the number of squares you’ll need for your first quilt let’s create two variables: quilt_width and quilt_length. Let’s make this first quilt 8 squares wide and 12 squares long.

# 2. Print out the number of squares you’ll need to create the quilt!

# 3. It turns out that quilt required a little more material than you have on hand! Let’s only make the quilt 8 squares long. How many squares will you need for this quilt instead?

quilt_width = 8
quilt_length = 8

#prints number of squares to make a quilt
print(quilt_width * quilt_length)
