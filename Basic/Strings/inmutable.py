# 1.The most recent hire at Copeland’s Corporate Company is a fellow named Rob Daily. Unfortunately, Human Resources seem to have made a bit of a typo and sent over the wrong first_name.
# Try changing the first character of first_name by running
# first_name[0] = "R"

# 2.Oh right! Strings are immutable, so we can’t change an individual character. Okay that’s no problem—we can still fix this!
# Delete the code you just wrote for step 1.
# Then, concatenate the string "R" with a slice of first_name that includes everything but the first character, "B", and save it to a new string fixed_first_name.

first_name = "Bob"
last_name = "Daily"

# first_name[0] = "R"
fixed_first_name = "R" + first_name[-2:]
