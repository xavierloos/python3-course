# 1.They sent over another list containing all the lines to the Audre Lorde poem, Love, Maybe. They want you to join together all of the lines into a single string that can be used to display the poem again, but this time, you’ve noticed that the list contains a ton of unnecessary whitespace that doesn’t appear in the actual poem.
# First, use .strip() on each line in the list to remove the unnecessary whitespace and save it as a new list love_maybe_lines_stripped.

# 2. .join() the lines in love_maybe_lines_stripped together into one large multi-line string, love_maybe_full, that can be printed to display the poem.
# Each line of the poem should show up on its own line.

# 3.Print love_maybe_full.
