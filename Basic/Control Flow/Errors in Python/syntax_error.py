# 1. In script.py, your coworker Carolyn wrote a Fortune Cookie program that is supposed to print out a possible fortune based on a random number and an if/elif/else statement.

# Run the program to check it out.
 
# 2. Oh no, there are three SyntaxError errors inside script.py!

# Can you find them all?
