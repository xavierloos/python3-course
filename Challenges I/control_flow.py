# 1. Large Power
# For the first code challenge, we are going to create a method that tests whether the result of taking the power of one number to another number provides an answer which is greater than 5000. We will use a conditional statement to return True if the result is greater than 5000 or return False if it is not. In order to accomplish this, we will need the following steps:

# Define the function to accept two input parameters called base and exponent
# Calculate the result of base to the power of exponent
# Use an if statement to test if the result is greater than 5000. If it is then return True. Otherwise, return False

# Write your large_power function here:
def large_power(base,exponent):
  if (base ** exponent) > 5000:
    return True
  else:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your large_power function:
print(large_power(2, 13))
# should print True
print(large_power(2, 12))
# should print False
