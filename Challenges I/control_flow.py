# 1. Large Power
# For the first code challenge, we are going to create a method that tests whether the result of taking the power of one number to another number provides an answer which is greater than 5000. We will use a conditional statement to return True if the result is greater than 5000 or return False if it is not. In order to accomplish this, we will need the following steps:

# Define the function to accept two input parameters called base and exponent
# Calculate the result of base to the power of exponent
# Use an if statement to test if the result is greater than 5000. If it is then return True. Otherwise, return False

# Write your large_power function here:
def large_power(base,exponent):
  if (base ** exponent) > 5000:
    return True
  else:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your large_power function:
print(large_power(2, 13))
# should print True
print(large_power(2, 12))
# should print False

# 2. Over Budget
# Letâ€™s say we are trying to save some money and we are watching our budget. We need to make sure that the result of our spending is less than the total amount we have allocated for each of the categories. Our function will accept a parameter called budget which describes our spending limit. The next four parameters describe what we are spending our money on. We need to sum all of our spendings and compare it to the budget. If we have gone over budget, we will return True. Otherwise we return False. Here are the steps we need:

# Define the function to accept five parameters starting with budget then food_bill, electricity_bill, internet_bill, and rent
# Calculate the sum of the last four parameters
# Use if and else statements to test if the budget is less than the sum of the calculated sum from the previous step.
# If the condition is true, return True otherwise return False

# Write your over_budget function here:
def over_budget( budget, food_bill, electricity_bill, internet_bill,  rent):
  sum = food_bill + electricity_bill + internet_bill +  rent
  if budget < sum:
    return True
  else:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your over_budget function:
print(over_budget(100, 20, 30, 10, 40))
# should print False
print(over_budget(80, 20, 30, 10, 30))
# should print True

# 3. Twice As Large
# In this challenge, we will determine if one number is twice as large as another number. To do this, we will compare the first number with two times the second number. Here are the steps:

# Define our function with two inputs num1 and num2
# Multiply the second input by 2
# Use an if statement to compare the result of the last calculation with the first input
# If num1 is greater then return True otherwise return False

# Write your twice_as_large function here:
def twice_as_large(num1, num2):
  if num1 > (num2 * 2):
    return True
  else:
    return False
# Uncomment these function calls to test your twice_as_large function:
print(twice_as_large(10, 5))
# should print False
print(twice_as_large(11, 5))
# should print True

# 4. Divisible By Ten
# To make things a bit more challenging, we are going to create a function that determines whether or not a number is divisible by ten. A number is divisible by ten if the remainder of the number divided by 10 is 0. Using this, we can complete this function in a few steps:

# Define the function header to accept one input num
# Calculate the remainder of the input divided by 10 (use modulus)
# Use an if statement to check if the remainder was 0. If the remainder was 0, return True, otherwise, return False

# Write your divisible_by_ten() function here:
def divisible_by_ten(num):
  if num % 10 == 0:
    return True
  else:
    return False

# Uncomment these print() function calls to test your divisible_by_ten() function:

print(divisible_by_ten(20))
# should print True
print(divisible_by_ten(25))
# should print False
