# 1. Tenth Power
# Letâ€™s create some functions which can help us solve math problems! For this first function, we are going to take the tenth power of a number. In order to do this we need to do three things:

# Set up the function header for tenth_power which accepts one parameter
# Take the tenth power of the input value
# Return the result
# Write your tenth_power function here:
def tenth_power(num):
    return num ** 10


# Uncomment these function calls to test your tenth_power function:
print(tenth_power(1))
# 1 to the 10th power is 1
print(tenth_power(0))
# 0 to the 10th power is 0
print(tenth_power(2))
# 2 to the 10th power is 1024
